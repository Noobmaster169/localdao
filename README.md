# LOCAL DAO

A Communtiy Application that provides Real World Organic Information from a Location-based Local Community. This DAO allows companies, goverments, and business owners to put incentives for a population in certain area to vote on the project

## Key problems

1. Lack of Community & Local Data
Business & Companies have high demand of real world organic data & feedbacks from the community. 
For example, companies like Coca Cola need to spend high budget & long time to find feedbacks from Malaysian people. 

2. Lack of Community Incentives for Feedbacks
Community are not encouraged to provide their feedbacks to other communities since they have no incentive in doing so

## How Do We Solve It
Build a location-based community governance, where users can vote based on their local communities. These will benefit companies who are looking for feedbacks from local communities, while also provide incentives for community to provide their feedbacks & opinions.

## How It Works
For example
Coca-cola wants to launch a new product in Malaysia. Instead of spending more budget & time to reach more people, they allocate $10.000 as a survey.

Malaysian people can enter Local DAO and proof that they're a Malaysian, then they can participate as a user in the survey.
The users who pariticipate in the survey will claim part of the distributed $10.000
